	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

	abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

	abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the knowledge of cyber and physical threats that help mitigate potential cyber attacks. The rapid evolution of the current threat landscape has seen many organisations share CTI to strengthen their security posture for mutual benefit. However, in many cases, CTI data contains attributes (e.g., software versions) that have the potential to leak sensitive information or cause reputational damage to the sharing organisation. While current approaches allow restricting CTI sharing to trusted organisations, they lack solutions where the shared data can be verified and disseminated ‘differentially’ (i.e., selective information sharing) with policies and metrics flexibly defined by an organisation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based CTI sharing framework that allows organisations to share sensitive CTI data in a trusted, verifiable and differential manner. We discuss the limitations associated with existing approaches and highlight the advantages of the proposed CTI sharing framework. We further present a detailed proof of concept using the Ethereum blockchain network. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework can facilitate the exchange of CTI without creating significant additional overheads.},

Today, threat actors are highly motivated, persistent, and well-founded and operate in a coordinated manner to commit a diversity of attacks using various sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures. Given the risks these threats present, it has become clear that organizations need to collaborate and share cyber threat information (CTI) and use it to improve their security posture. In this paper, we present TRADE -- TRusted Anonymous Data Exchange -- a collaborative, distributed, trusted, and anonymized CTI sharing platform based on blockchain technology. TRADE uses a blockchain-based access control framework designed to provide essential features and requirements to incentivize and encourage organizations to share threat intelligence information. In TRADE, organizations can fully control their data by defining sharing policies enforced by smart contracts used to control and manage CTI sharing in the network. TRADE allows organizations to preserve their anonymity while keeping organizations fully accountable for their action in the network. Finally, TRADE can be easily integrated within existing threat intelligence exchange protocols - such as trusted automated exchange of intelligence information (TAXII) and OpenDXL, thereby allowing a fast and smooth technology adaptation.},

This change diversifies the attacker’s attack vectors, increasing the impact and damage of cyber threats. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) technology is a proof-based security system which responds to these advanced cyber threats proactively by analyzing and sharing security-related data. However, the performance of CTI systems can be significantly compromised by creating and disseminating improper security policies if an attacker intentionally injects malicious data into the system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based CTI framework that improves confidence in the source and content of the data and can quickly detect and eliminate inaccurate data for resistance to a Sybil attack. The proposed framework collects CTI by a procedure validated through smart contracts and stores information about the metainformation of data in a blockchain network. The proposed system ensures the validity and reliability of CTI data by ensuring traceability to the data source and proposes a system model that can efficiently operate and manage CTI data in compliance with the de facto standard. We present the simulation results to prove the effectiveness and Sybil-resistance of the proposed framework in terms of reliability and cost to attackers.},

	abstract = {Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) sharing provides cybersecurity operations an advantage over adversaries by more quickly characterizing the threat, understanding its tactics, anticipating the objective, and identifying the vulnerability and mitigation. However, organizations struggle with sharing threat intelligence due, in part, to the legal and financial risk of being associated with a potential malware campaign or threat group. An entity wishing to share threat information or obtain information about a specific threat risks being associated as a victim of the threat actors, resulting in costly legal disputes, regulatory investigation, and reputational damage. As a result, the threat intelligence data needed for cybersecurity situational awareness and vulnerability mitigation often lacks volume, quality, and timeliness. We propose a distributed blockchain ledger to facilitate sharing of cybersecurity threat information and provide a mechanism for entities to have non-attributable participation in a threat-sharing community. Learning from Distributed Anonymous Payment (DAP) schemes in cryptocurrency, we use a new token-based authentication scheme for use in a permissioned blockchain. The anonymous token authentication allows a consortium of semi-trusted entities to share the workload of curating CTI for the community’s cooperative benefit.},

	abstract = {Publicly accessible databases are an indispensable resource for retrieving up-to-date information. But they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the user, since a curious database operator can follow the user's queries and infer what the user is after. Indeed, in cases where the users' intentions are to be kept secret, users are often cautious about accessing the database. It can be shown that when accessing a single database, to completely guarantee the privacy of the user, the whole database should be down-loaded; namely n bits should be communicated (where n is the number of bits in the database).In this work, we investigate whether by replicating the database, more efficient solutions to the private retrieval problem can be obtained. We describe schemes that enable a user to access k replicated copies of a database (k≥2) and privately retrieve information stored in the database. This means that each individual server (holding a replicated copy of the database) gets no information on the identity of the item retrieved by the user. Our schemes use the replication to gain substantial saving. In particular, we present a two-server scheme with communication complexity O(n1/3).},

Each server stores only a part of the database, its computational complexity depends only on this part, and multiple blocks can be queried efficiently in parallel. RAID-PIR improves efficiency over known PIR protocols, using only very efficient cryptographic primitives (pseudo-random generator). We demonstrate that RAID-PIR is practical and well-suited for cloud deployment as it reduces the communication as well as the computational workload per server.},

	abstract = {Since 1995, much work has been done creating protocols for private information retrieval (PIR). Many variants of the basic PIR model have been proposed, including such modifications as computational vs. information-theoretic privacy protection, correctness in the face of servers that fail to respond or that respond incorrectly, and protection of sensitive data against the database servers themselves. In this paper, we improve on the robustness of PIR in a number of ways. First, we present a Byzantine-robust PIR protocol which provides information-theoretic privacy protection against coalitions of up to all but one of the responding servers, improving the previous result by a factor of 3. In addition, our protocol allows for more of the responding servers to return incorrect information while still enabling the user to compute the correct result. We then extend our protocol so that queries have information-theoretic protection if a limited number of servers collude, as before, but still retain computational protection if they all collude. We also extend the protocol to provide information-theoretic protection to the contents of the database against collusions of limited numbers of the database servers, at no additional communication cost or increase in the number of servers. All of our protocols retrieve a block of data with communication cost only O(lscr) times the size of the block, where lscr is the number of servers. Finally, we discuss our implementation of these protocols, and measure their performance in order to determine their practicality.},

Our construction improves on previous works in two aspects: 1) We show that "somewhat homomorphic" encryption can be based on LWE, using a new re-linearization technique. In contrast, all previous schemes relied on complexity assumptions related to ideals in various rings. 2) We deviate from the "squashing paradigm" used in all previous works. We introduce a new dimension-modulus reduction technique, which shortens the ciphertexts and reduces the decryption complexity of our scheme, without introducing additional assumptions. Our scheme has very short ciphertexts and we therefore use it to construct an asymptotically efficient LWE-based single-server private information retrieval (PIR) protocol. The communication complexity of our protocol (in the public-key model) is k · polylog(k) + log {\textbar}DB{\textbar} bits per single-bit query (here, A; is a security parameter).},

In this paper, we present a single server PIR protocol that has low communication cost and is much faster than existing protocols. A major building block of the PIR protocol in this paper is a tree-based compression scheme, which we call folding/unfolding. This compression scheme enables us to lower the communication complexity to O(loglogn). The other major building block is the BGV fully homomorphic encryption scheme. We show how we design the protocol to exploit the internal parallelism of the BGV scheme. This significantly reduces the server side computational overhead and makes our protocol much faster than the existing protocols. Our protocol can be further accelerated by utilising hardware parallelism. We have built a prototype of the protocol. We report on the performance of our protocol based on the prototype and compare it with the current most efficient protocols.},

	abstract = {We present a single-database private information retrieval (PIR) scheme with communication complexity \$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal O\}(k+d)\$, where k ≥ log n is a security parameter that depends on the database size n and d is the bit-length of the retrieved database block. This communication complexity is better asymptotically than previous single-database PIR schemes. The scheme also gives improved performance for practical parameter settings whether the user is retrieving a single bit or very large blocks. For large blocks, our scheme achieves a constant “rate” (e.g., 0.2), even when the user-side communication is very low (e.g., two 1024-bit numbers). Our scheme and security analysis is presented using general groups with hidden smooth subgroups; the scheme can be instantiated using composite moduli, in which case the security of our scheme is based on a simple variant of the “Φ-hiding” assumption by Cachin, Micali and Stadler [2].},

	abstract = {The advent of blockchain technology has revolutionized Internet-of-Thing (IoT) systems offering immutable and transparent ledger mechanisms. However, this transformative technology has also brought significant challenges related to user privacy. Though the existing solutions offer various privacy enrichment in blockchain systems through cryptographic methods, the problems of deanonymization (the issue of revealing users’ identities) and linkability of transactions still persist. Furthermore, recent reported news also shows privacy leakages in blockchain systems. Thus, we require a comprehensive privacy-assured blockchain framework to address the above-mentioned problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel privacy-preserving framework for blockchain transactions along with private information retrieval (PIR) to combat the above-mentioned privacy issues in blockchains. We call our proposed approach “PRIvacy-ensured framework for Blockchain trANsactions with pIr (PRIBANI)”. PRIBANI uses randomizing ring signatures, Public key Encryption-based Keyword Search (PEKS), and PIR techniques to protect the privacy of the user and the history of the transaction data. We run a set of experiments on our proposed PRIBANI to evaluate the privacy attainment of the framework based on user anonymity, transaction anonymity, and unlinkability. We also compare PRIBANI with state-of-the-art models and show that PRIBANI gives a better throughput with an average of 56 transactions per second (TPS) and incurs low latency which is approximately 5\% less than the existing schemes and an average communication overhead of 3.2 kilobytes (kbytes). Overall, PRIBANI is efficient in executing privacy-ensured blockchain transactions.},

	abstract = {The integration of blockchain technology into consumer electronics is transforming healthcare by enhancing data security and streamlining operations in devices like wearable health monitors, smart medical devices, and electronic health records. However, this integration raises significant privacy concerns, especially regarding potential data leaks through automated processes like smart contracts. Traditional Private Information Retrieval (PIR) methods struggle with balancing data accessibility and patient confidentiality. This creates computational inefficiencies and interoperability challenges that hinder the implementation of standardized privacy measures in blockchain. We introduce the MUlti-Dimensional pRivacy Attainment (MUDRA) framework, a novel solution addressing critical privacy challenges in the storage and retrieval of patient and healthcare service provider (HSP) data. MUDRA leverages the innovative Dual Server Ring Private Information Retrieval (DS-RPIR) protocol to securely retrieve Personal Health Information (PHI) without publishing sensitive data to the blockchain, ensuring enhanced privacy and preventing unauthorized access. By integrating the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), MUDRA preserves data confidentiality and supports time-controlled revocation, allowing patients to set time-limited access to their medical records, automatically revoking access after the specified period. The framework introduces a new metric, Privacy Attainment (PA), to quantify transaction privacy and evaluate the private retrieval of sensitive data. When implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric network, MUDRA achieves 3.5\% higher throughput (59 TPS), reduced time complexity O(nlogn) , and 8 ms latency—2.25 ms less than existing solutions. These performance improvements, coupled with robust privacy features, position MUDRA as a pioneering solution for addressing privacy concerns in the rapidly evolving field of healthcare consumer electronics.},

In this paper, we propose the first decentralized business model that uses the PIR. We call our proposed model DEcentralized Business model with PIR (DEBPIR). DEBPIR uses a smart contract for PIR and encryption to share the privacy of classified information. We execute a thorough set of experiments on DEBPIR and evaluate the results based on privacy attainment, latency, and throughput. We also perform a comparative analysis between our proposed DEBPIR and the existing models; we observe that DEBPIR outperforms the existing models and provides \$\$95{\textbackslash}\%\$\$privacy attainment.

Despite these efforts, we argue that the exposure of retrieval information may result in privacy leakage, which inevitably poses an important yet unresolved challenge. In this paper, we introduce Cloak, a novel privacy-preserving blockchain query scheme with two notable features. First, it utilizes a two-phase distributed query requests technique, i.e., division and aggregation, to hide retrieval information based on the natural independent characteristic of blockchain. Second, we add noise to the sub-request set to avoid malicious attacks during transmission and adopt smart contract-based asymmetric encryption to guarantee the correctness of query results. Experimental results demonstrate that Cloak improves the query performance by up to 4× and reduces the storage overhead by 50\% compared with the state-of-the-art Spiral.},

	abstract = {We present a radically new approach to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) that dramatically improves performance and bases security on weaker assumptions. A central conceptual contribution in our work is a new way of constructing leveled fully homomorphic encryption schemes (capable of evaluating arbitrary polynomial-size circuits), \{{\textbackslash}em without Gentry's bootstrapping procedure\}.

Specifically, we offer a choice of FHE schemes based on the learning with error (LWE) or ring-LWE (RLWE) problems that have 2{\textbackslash}secparam security against known attacks. For RLWE, we have:

1. A leveled FHE scheme that can evaluate L-level arithmetic circuits with O{\textasciitilde}({\textbackslash}secparam⋅L3) per-gate computation -- i.e., computation \{{\textbackslash}em quasi-linear\} in the security parameter. Security is based on RLWE for an approximation factor exponential in L. This construction does not use the bootstrapping procedure.

2. A leveled FHE scheme that uses bootstrapping \{{\textbackslash}em as an optimization\}, where the per-gate computation (which includes the bootstrapping procedure) is O{\textasciitilde}({\textbackslash}secparam2), \{{\textbackslash}em independent of L\}. Security is based on the hardness of RLWE for \{{\textbackslash}em quasi-polynomial\} factors (as opposed to the sub-exponential factors needed in previous schemes).

We obtain similar results for LWE, but with worse performance. We introduce a number of further optimizations to our schemes. As an example, for circuits of large width -- e.g., where a constant fraction of levels have width at least {\textbackslash}secparam -- we can reduce the per-gate computation of the bootstrapped version to O{\textasciitilde}({\textbackslash}secparam), independent of L, by \{{\textbackslash}em batching the bootstrapping operation\}. Previous FHE schemes all required Ω{\textasciitilde}({\textbackslash}secparam3.5) computation per gate.

At the core of our construction is a much more effective approach for managing the noise level of lattice-based ciphertexts as homomorphic operations are performed, using some new techniques recently introduced by Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan (FOCS 2011).},

This noise is originally added to the plaintext for security, but considered to be a part of error occurring during approximate computations that is reduced along with plaintext by rescaling. As a result, our decryption structure outputs an approximate value of plaintext with a predetermined precision.},
