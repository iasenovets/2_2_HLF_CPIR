	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

	abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

	abstract = {Publicly accessible databases are an indispensable resource for retrieving up-to-date information. But they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the user, since a curious database operator can follow the user's queries and infer what the user is after. Indeed, in cases where the users' intentions are to be kept secret, users are often cautious about accessing the database. It can be shown that when accessing a single database, to completely guarantee the privacy of the user, the whole database should be down-loaded; namely n bits should be communicated (where n is the number of bits in the database).In this work, we investigate whether by replicating the database, more efficient solutions to the private retrieval problem can be obtained. We describe schemes that enable a user to access k replicated copies of a database (k≥2) and privately retrieve information stored in the database. This means that each individual server (holding a replicated copy of the database) gets no information on the identity of the item retrieved by the user. Our schemes use the replication to gain substantial saving. In particular, we present a two-server scheme with communication complexity O(n1/3).},

	abstract = {Since 1995, much work has been done creating protocols for private information retrieval (PIR). Many variants of the basic PIR model have been proposed, including such modifications as computational vs. information-theoretic privacy protection, correctness in the face of servers that fail to respond or that respond incorrectly, and protection of sensitive data against the database servers themselves. In this paper, we improve on the robustness of PIR in a number of ways. First, we present a Byzantine-robust PIR protocol which provides information-theoretic privacy protection against coalitions of up to all but one of the responding servers, improving the previous result by a factor of 3. In addition, our protocol allows for more of the responding servers to return incorrect information while still enabling the user to compute the correct result. We then extend our protocol so that queries have information-theoretic protection if a limited number of servers collude, as before, but still retain computational protection if they all collude. We also extend the protocol to provide information-theoretic protection to the contents of the database against collusions of limited numbers of the database servers, at no additional communication cost or increase in the number of servers. All of our protocols retrieve a block of data with communication cost only O(lscr) times the size of the block, where lscr is the number of servers. Finally, we discuss our implementation of these protocols, and measure their performance in order to determine their practicality.},

Each server stores only a part of the database, its computational complexity depends only on this part, and multiple blocks can be queried efficiently in parallel. RAID-PIR improves efficiency over known PIR protocols, using only very efficient cryptographic primitives (pseudo-random generator).

Our scheme and security analysis is presented using general groups with hidden smooth subgroups; the scheme can be instantiated using composite moduli, in which case the security of our scheme is based on a simple variant of the “Φ-hiding” assumption by Cachin, Micali and Stadler [2].},

Our construction improves on previous works in two aspects: 1) We show that "somewhat homomorphic" encryption can be based on LWE, using a new re-linearization technique. In contrast, all previous schemes relied on complexity assumptions related to ideals in various rings. 2) We deviate from the "squashing paradigm" used in all previous works. We introduce a new dimension-modulus reduction technique, which shortens the ciphertexts and reduces the decryption complexity of our scheme, without introducing additional assumptions. Our scheme has very short ciphertexts and we therefore use it to construct an asymptotically efficient LWE-based single-server private information retrieval (PIR) protocol. The communication complexity of our protocol (in the public-key model) is k · polylog(k) + log {\textbar}DB{\textbar} bits per single-bit query (here, A; is a security parameter).},

A major building block of the PIR protocol in this paper is a tree-based compression scheme, which we call folding/unfolding. This compression scheme enables us to lower the communication complexity to O(loglogn). The other major building block is the BGV fully homomorphic encryption scheme. We show how we design the protocol to exploit the internal parallelism of the BGV scheme. This significantly reduces the server side computational overhead and makes our protocol much faster than the existing protocols. Our protocol can be further accelerated by utilising hardware parallelism. We have built a prototype of the protocol. We report on the performance of our protocol based on the prototype and compare it with the current most efficient protocols.},

To achieve these efficiency goals, our protocols work in an offline/online model. In an offline phase, which takes place before the client has decided which database bit it wants to read, the client fetches a short string from the servers. In a subsequent online phase, the client can privately retrieve its desired bit of the database by making a second query to the servers. By pushing the bulk of the server-side computation into the offline phase (which is independent of the client's query), our protocols allow the online phase to complete very quickly---in time sublinear in the size of the database. Our protocols can provide statistical security in the two-server setting and computational security in the single-server setting. Finally, we prove that, in this model, our protocols are optimal in terms of the trade-off they achieve between communication and running time.",

	abstract = {A (single server) private information retrieval (PIR) allows a client to read data from a public database held on a remote server, without revealing to the server which locations she is reading. In a doubly efficient PIR (DEPIR), the database is first preprocessed, but the server can subsequently answer any client’s query in time that is sub-linear in the database size. Prior work gave a plausible candidate for a public-key variant of DEPIR, where a trusted party is needed to securely preprocess the database and generate a corresponding public key for the clients; security relied on a new non-standard code-based assumption and a heuristic use of ideal obfuscation. In this work we construct the stronger unkeyed notion of DEPIR, where the preprocessing is a deterministic procedure that the server can execute on its own. Moreover, we prove security under just the standard ring learning-with-errors (RingLWE) assumption. For a database of size N and any constant ε>0, the preprocessing run-time and size is O(N1+ε), while the run-time and communication-complexity of each PIR query is polylog(N). We also show how to update the preprocessed database in time O(Nε). Our approach is to first construct a standard PIR where the server’s computation consists of evaluating a multivariate polynomial; we then convert it to a DEPIR by preprocessing the polynomial to allow for fast evaluation, using the techniques of Kedlaya and Umans (STOC ’08). Building on top of our DEPIR, we construct general fully homomorphic encryption for random-access machines (RAM-FHE), which allows a server to homomorphically evaluate an arbitrary RAM program P over a client’s encrypted input x and the server’s preprocessed plaintext input y to derive an encryption of the output P(x,y) in time that scales with the RAM run-time of the computation rather than its circuit size. Prior work only gave a heuristic candidate construction of a restricted notion of RAM-FHE. In this work, we construct RAM-FHE under the RingLWE assumption with circular security. For a RAM program P with worst-case run-time T, the homomorphic evaluation runs in time T1+ε · (|x| + |y|).},

	abstract = {We introduce YPIR, a single-server private information retrieval (PIR) protocol that achieves high throughput (up to 83\% of the memory bandwidth of the machine) without any offline communication. For retrieving a 1-bit (or 1-byte) record from a 32 GB database, YPIR achieves 12.1 GB/s/core server throughput and requires 2.5 MB of total communication. On the same setup, the state-of-the-art SimplePIR protocol achieves a 12.5 GB/s/core server throughput, requires 1.5 MB total communication, but additionally requires downloading a 724 MB hint in an offline phase. YPIR leverages a new lightweight technique to remove the hint from high-throughput single-server PIR schemes with small overhead. We also show how to reduce the server preprocessing time in the SimplePIR family of protocols by a factor of 10-15 \texttimes{}.By removing the need for offline communication, YPIR significantly reduces the server-side costs for private auditing of Certificate Transparency logs. Compared to the best previous PIR-based approach, YPIR reduces the server-side costs by a factor of 8\texttimes{}. Note that to reduce communication costs, the previous approach assumed that updates to the Certificate Transparency log servers occurred in weekly batches. Since there is no offline communication in YPIR, our approach allows clients to always audit the most recent Certificate Transparency logs (e.g., updating once a day). Supporting daily updates using the prior scheme would cost 48 \texttimes{} more than YPIR (based on current AWS compute costs).},

Our scheme achieves amortized $\tilde O(\sqrt n )$ server and client computation and $O(\sqrt n )$ online communication per query, and requires ${\tilde O_\lambda }(\sqrt n )$ client storage. Unlike prior single-server PIR schemes that rely on heavy cryptographic machinery such as Homomorphic Encryption, our scheme relies only on Pseudo-Random Functions (PRF). To the best of our knowledge, Piano is the first practical single-server sublinear-time PIR scheme, and we outperform the state-of-the-art single-server PIR by 10×-300×. In comparison with the best known two-server PIR scheme, Piano enjoys comparable performance but our construction is considerably simpler. Experimental results show that for a 100GB database and with 60ms round-trip latency, Piano achieves 93ms response time, while the best known prior scheme requires 11s or more. },

Recent advances in blockchain query schemes mainly focus on enhancing the traceability efficiency of integrity authentication. Despite these efforts, we argue that the exposure of retrieval information may result in privacy leakage, which inevitably poses an important yet unresolved challenge. In this paper, we introduce Cloak, a novel privacy-preserving blockchain query scheme with two notable features. First, it utilizes a two-phase distributed query requests technique, i.e., division and aggregation, to hide retrieval information based on the natural independent characteristic of blockchain. Second, we add noise to the sub-request set to avoid malicious attacks during transmission and adopt smart contract-based asymmetric encryption to guarantee the correctness of query results. Experimental results demonstrate that Cloak improves the query performance by up to 4× and reduces the storage overhead by 50\% compared with the state-of-the-art Spiral.},

In this paper, we propose the first decentralized business model that uses the PIR. We call our proposed model DEcentralized Business model with PIR (DEBPIR). DEBPIR uses a smart contract for PIR and encryption to share the privacy of classified information. We execute a thorough set of experiments on DEBPIR and evaluate the results based on privacy attainment, latency, and throughput. We also perform a comparative analysis between our proposed DEBPIR and the existing models; we observe that DEBPIR outperforms the existing models and provides \$\$95{\textbackslash}\%\$\$privacy attainment.

	abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the knowledge of cyber and physical threats that help mitigate potential cyber attacks. The rapid evolution of the current threat landscape has seen many organisations share CTI to strengthen their security posture for mutual benefit. However, in many cases, CTI data contains attributes (e.g., software versions) that have the potential to leak sensitive information or cause reputational damage to the sharing organisation. While current approaches allow restricting CTI sharing to trusted organisations, they lack solutions where the shared data can be verified and disseminated ‘differentially’ (i.e., selective information sharing) with policies and metrics flexibly defined by an organisation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based CTI sharing framework that allows organisations to share sensitive CTI data in a trusted, verifiable and differential manner. We discuss the limitations associated with existing approaches and highlight the advantages of the proposed CTI sharing framework. We further present a detailed proof of concept using the Ethereum blockchain network. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework can facilitate the exchange of CTI without creating significant additional overheads.},

	abstract = {Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) sharing provides cybersecurity operations an advantage over adversaries by more quickly characterizing the threat, understanding its tactics, anticipating the objective, and identifying the vulnerability and mitigation. However, organizations struggle with sharing threat intelligence due, in part, to the legal and financial risk of being associated with a potential malware campaign or threat group. An entity wishing to share threat information or obtain information about a specific threat risks being associated as a victim of the threat actors, resulting in costly legal disputes, regulatory investigation, and reputational damage. As a result, the threat intelligence data needed for cybersecurity situational awareness and vulnerability mitigation often lacks volume, quality, and timeliness. We propose a distributed blockchain ledger to facilitate sharing of cybersecurity threat information and provide a mechanism for entities to have non-attributable participation in a threat-sharing community. Learning from Distributed Anonymous Payment (DAP) schemes in cryptocurrency, we use a new token-based authentication scheme for use in a permissioned blockchain. The anonymous token authentication allows a consortium of semi-trusted entities to share the workload of curating CTI for the community’s cooperative benefit.},

Today, threat actors are highly motivated, persistent, and well-founded and operate in a coordinated manner to commit a diversity of attacks using various sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures. Given the risks these threats present, it has become clear that organizations need to collaborate and share cyber threat information (CTI) and use it to improve their security posture. In this paper, we present TRADE -- TRusted Anonymous Data Exchange -- a collaborative, distributed, trusted, and anonymized CTI sharing platform based on blockchain technology. TRADE uses a blockchain-based access control framework designed to provide essential features and requirements to incentivize and encourage organizations to share threat intelligence information. In TRADE, organizations can fully control their data by defining sharing policies enforced by smart contracts used to control and manage CTI sharing in the network. TRADE allows organizations to preserve their anonymity while keeping organizations fully accountable for their action in the network. Finally, TRADE can be easily integrated within existing threat intelligence exchange protocols - such as trusted automated exchange of intelligence information (TAXII) and OpenDXL, thereby allowing a fast and smooth technology adaptation.},

This change diversifies the attacker’s attack vectors, increasing the impact and damage of cyber threats. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) technology is a proof-based security system which responds to these advanced cyber threats proactively by analyzing and sharing security-related data. However, the performance of CTI systems can be significantly compromised by creating and disseminating improper security policies if an attacker intentionally injects malicious data into the system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based CTI framework that improves confidence in the source and content of the data and can quickly detect and eliminate inaccurate data for resistance to a Sybil attack. The proposed framework collects CTI by a procedure validated through smart contracts and stores information about the metainformation of data in a blockchain network. The proposed system ensures the validity and reliability of CTI data by ensuring traceability to the data source and proposes a system model that can efficiently operate and manage CTI data in compliance with the de facto standard. We present the simulation results to prove the effectiveness and Sybil-resistance of the proposed framework in terms of reliability and cost to attackers.},

This noise is originally added to the plaintext for security, but considered to be a part of error occurring during approximate computations that is reduced along with plaintext by rescaling. As a result, our decryption structure outputs an approximate value of plaintext with a predetermined precision.},
